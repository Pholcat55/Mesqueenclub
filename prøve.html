<div style="text-align: left;">
<h2>Bygging av Camp Nou</h2>
<p style="text-align: start;">Camp Nou took over from FC Barcelona's former stadium, Camp de Les Corts, in 1957. A proposal for a new stadium had already been made<br> in 1948, but it wasn't until Hungarian star Ladislao Kubala joined the club that people started talking about Barça had grown from the <br>  Camp de Les Corts. Camp de Les Corts was completed in 1922, and after <br> several major developments, a total of 60,000 spectators were squeezed in, a number that was seen as unjustified to exceed.

   It was therefore <br> decided at the board meeting on 19 September 1950 that a new plot of land should be purchased for development. A plot of <br> land next to Maternitat was acquired, close to the old Les Corts stadium. However, it did not go as planned. Just over six months later, several <br> of the members of the commission responsible for planning the new stadium began to change their minds about the choice of location. <br> Instead of Maternitat, there was a desire for a property on Diagonal.
   
   This led to the project being put on hold until Francesc Miró-Sans won <br> the presidential election in 1953. The new stadium became his most <br> important cause, and in February 1954 it was decided to build on the original property at Maternitat and not at Diagonal. On 28 March 1954, <br> in front of 60,000 fans, Miró-Sans laid the first brick of the new Camp Nou stadium.
   
   The responsibility for the design of the new stadium <br> was placed in the hands of the architects Francesc Mitjans Miró (Miró-Sans' cousin), Josep <br> Soteras Mauri and Lorenzo García Barbón. Just over a year later, the contract for the construction itself was given to INGAR SA, <br> which was to take 66.6 million pesetas for a job of 18 months.
   
   As with many other large construction projects, the budget was also exceeded <br> here. When the construction was finished, a sum of approximately 288 <br> million pesetas was calculated, which the club had to finance with loans of over 160 million pesetas. The stadium was financed, but <br> with the purchase you got a debt that you were forced to pay for several years afterwards. </p>
